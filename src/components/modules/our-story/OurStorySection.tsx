          Our Story
        </h2>
        <p className="text-base text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
          Rooted in a love for greenery, we started with a simple mission: to
          bring the beauty of plants into every home. What began as a small
          passion project has grown just like our plants into a place where
          nature meets nurture. Whether you are a seasoned plant parent or just
          starting out, weâ€™re here to help your space thrive with fresh, healthy
          plants and expert tips along the way.
